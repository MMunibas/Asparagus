## What is this?
 - A refined implementation of PhysNet and PainNN (and more atomistic NN to come) in PyTorch. 
 - A Suit for the automatic construction of Potential Energy Surface (PES) from sampling to production.

## How to use?

### Setting up the environment

We recommend to use [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) for the creation of a virtual environment. 

Once in mamba, you can create a virtual enviroment called *asparagus* 

``` 
mamba create --name asparagus python=3.8
```
 
To activate the virtual environment use the command:

```
mamba activate asparagus
```

### Installation
Installation must be done in the virtual environment through pip. It is important to mention that the path where you are
working will be added to the *PYTHONPATH*, so you can import the modules from anywhere.

Install via pip:
``` 
python -m pip install .
```
Alternatively, but deprecated, install via setup.py:
``` 
python setup.py install
```

**BEWARE**: With this command any modification that is done to the code in the folder *asparagus* will be automatically reflected 
in the modules that you import.

**NOTE**: Everytime you want to import the module, you must use the following command:

```
from asparagus import Asparagus
```
Then Asparagus is a function that takes some arguments.
