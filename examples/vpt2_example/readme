Getting Started

This example describes how to use Second Order Vibrational Pertrubation Theory (VPT2) to obtain anharmonic frequencies using Asparagus and Gaussian software.

***
With your Asparagus environment enabled, install the required package:

pip install fortranformat==0.2.5

***
Geometry optimization using Gaussian with external potential:
To do this, modify the opt_min.com file with your charge, multiplicity, and coordinates. Replace the .json file with your model .json file in asp_freq.py and asp_energy_forces.py
Then submit the optimization job using gview:
gview opt_min.com
ctrl + g
submit
submit
YES

After optimization, replace the coordinates in asp_vpt2.com with the Cartesian coordinates of your optimized structure.
Then submit the VPT2 calculation using gview:
gview asp_vpt2.com
ctrl + g
submit
submit
YES
