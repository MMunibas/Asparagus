Argon - Water +

orca_pbe:

Run cationic Argon + Water sampling using ORCA ASE calculator.
This requires addition to the bashrc, where you need to adopt
the ORCADIR variable pointing to your ORCA directory that has
the exectubles

  # ORCA
  export ORCADIR=/home/toepfer/programs/orca5
  export PATH=$ORCADIR:$PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORCADIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export ORCA_COMMAND="$ORCADIR/orca"
  export ASE_ORCA_COMMAND="$ORCADIR/orca PREFIX.inp > PREFIX.out"


Now you can run the 'python run_orca.py' in the directory to
start the sampling and the PhysNet training. Note that the
you adopt the path of the Asparagus package at the top of
run_orca.py or add the path to the PYTHONPATH variable.




shell_orca_pbe:

This directory using the template based 'shell' calculator.
Here a shell file '../templates/shell/run_orca.sh' will be
executed after the input file '../templates/shell/run_orca.inp'
is copied to the working directory and the flags within are
changed to the input of the current sample to compute.
After the ORCA commmand in the run_orca.sh file finished
it runs the python file '../templates/shell/run_orca.py' to
read the respective data from the output file.

Important is here to adopt '../templates/shell/run_orca.sh'
to your system by adopting the orca executable file path if
not added to the PATH variable.
However, when running on multiple cores (change number next to
'nproc' in the '../templates/shell/run_orca.inp' file from 1
to, e.g., 4) than you need to change 'orca' with the absolute
file path, e.g., '/home/toepfer/Programs/orca5/orca' (that is
an ORCA thing).

If everything is set up well, run again 'python run_arh2o.py'
(the python file is named different than in orca_pbe to avoid
confusion with the template file names).



slurm_molpro_mp2:

This directory using the template based 'shell' calculator.
Here a shell file '../templates/shell/run_molprp.sh' will be
executed with 'sbatch' after the input file 
'../templates/shell/run_molpro.inp' is copied to the working
directory and the flags within are changed to the input of 
the current sample to compute.
The molpro input file is written to run a MP2 calculation.

CURRENTLY, the reading script '../templates/slurm/run_molpro.py'
does not work, as the XML file written by MOLPRO has changed
and the '../templates/slurm/run_molpro.y' cannot correctly read
the result data.
This need to be adopted.



ensemble_training:

This directory contains the ORCA database and an example script
for the trainning of a ensemble of models.
